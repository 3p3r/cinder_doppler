# Cinder Doppler

An implementation of [Microsoft Research's SoundWave](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/redmond/groups/cue/publications/guptasoundwavechi2012.pdf) (motion tracking with Doppler effect)

For compilation, you need to put [Cinder 0.8.6](http://libcinder.org/releases/cinder_0.8.6_vc2013.zip) in a directory and define the environment variable `CINDER_086` to point to its root. You also need to build `CINDER_086` as well (in both Debug and Release).
